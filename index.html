      <b><span style='font-size:24.0pt;color:red'>The Goodburn 2020 scandal is a clear travesty by the league. Goodburn has the league in his pocket and is paying them to stop me and everyone else who knows the truth. Don't believe me? Watch his "apology" video and notice how he steps up on a platform when he gets to the podium.</span></b>

      <b><span style='font-size:24.0pt;color:#000075'><u>THERE IS NO WAY HE IS THAT TALL!</u></span></b>

      <b><span style='font-size:24.0pt;color:black'><u>He is clearly recording this in the basement of one of the selection committee, who will almost surely try to kill me for telling the truth, but I will be telling the truth because it's important the truth comes out. If it doesn't then THEY will finally succeed in stealing all the beer in the world and forcing us to only drink SODA WATER. SODA WATER is what the so-called selection committee wants us all to drink</u></span></b>

      <br>
      <br>
      <b><span style='font-size:36.0pt;color:red'>Do you think it's a coincidence that THEY want us to drink SODA WATER? NO! SODA WATER will keep us all compliant when the selection committee decides to murder us in our sleep. It's no coincidence that The Goodburn team's name has TWO O's in it, and their slogan "forgive" and "forget" ALSO HAS TWO O's. DO THEY THINK WE WOULDN"T NOTICE WE NOTICED AND WE WILL KEEP NOTICING. DOWN WITH GOODBURN IN 2020 THE TEAM IS A DISGRACE, goodburn was late because he was helpign the SELECTION COMMITTEEE steal beer and replace it with SODA WATER </span></b>
